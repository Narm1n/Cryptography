    "This report provides an overview and analysis of a Python code designed to encrypt and decrypt files using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode. AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used for securing sensitive data. ECB mode is one of the simplest block cipher modes of operation, where each block of plaintext is encrypted independently."

    "The Python code uses the Crypto.Cipher module from the pycryptodome library to implement AES encryption and decryption functionalities. The script consists of the following key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Padding Function: The pad function ensures that the plaintext is padded to a multiple of 16 bytes to meet the block size requirement of AES. It appends bytes indicating the padding length to the plaintext.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Encryption Function: The encrypt_file_ecb function takes an input file, output file, and encryption key as parameters. It reads the input file in 16-byte chunks, pads the last chunk if necessary, encrypts each chunk using AES in ECB mode, and writes the encrypted data to the output file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Decryption Function: The decrypt_file_ecb function decrypts the encrypted file using the provided key. Similar to encryption, it reads the encrypted file in 16-byte chunks, decrypts each chunk using AES, removes the padding, and writes the decrypted data to the output file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Example Usage: The script demonstrates the usage of encryption and decryption functions by encrypting an input file and then decrypting the encrypted file back to its original form."
